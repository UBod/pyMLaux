# pyMLaux

This package contains some auxiliary functions that are hopefully useful in machine learning projects and courses. The functions implemented in this package mainly deal with evaluating machine learning results, but there are also some basic tools for data wrangling and visualization.

### Installation

The easiest way of installing the package is via running the following command (if executed from inside a Jupyter or Colab notebook, prefix the command with an exclamation mark '!'):
``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/UBod/pyMLaux.git
```
On your private Python system, you only need to run this command once (or whenever the package has been updated).
